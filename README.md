<h2>Project 1: Client-side Game</h2>

<h3>i. Tom and Jerry Tennis Hangman</h3>

This game is a Tom and Jerry Hangman with words related to the cartoon. In this game you will receive a small clue as to what the word is related to (whether it's Tom or Jerry). If the winner wins, a "You Win" message in green will appear, and if the winner loses, a "You Lose" message in red will appear. To get a new word you can click "New Game" as much as you want. You have your chances on the left letting you know when Tom gets hit with the tennis ball.
